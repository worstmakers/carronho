# Carronho's history

This whole project was conducted by [Jenny DeVito](https://github.com/JennyDeVito).

Carronho is a prototype for Carrildo which is the Michael Reeves' [screaming roomba](https://youtu.be/mvz3LRK263E?si=fZV57KYAUSREgQE5) bootleg.

The main purpose of it's existence was to test the algorithm: forward\stop\backward\choose direction\forward again and ligth the red LED when the it was supposed to be screaming. And to pass the time until the components to Carrildo arrived.

The most important thing in selecting the components for the Carronho project was that the components needed to be available for purchasing in the Santa Efigênia neighborhood (São Paulo, SP/Brasil), because we were already waiting for the delivery of the components for Carrildo that were bought in ~~Motherland China~~ AliExpress (and I, couldn't wait to ~~play~~ test my new projct).

It started with a L298N H bridge driver, which I bougth only one and it came broken.

Then, I bought a L9110S H bridge driver, that worked partially (one of the gears were with very low rotation until it stopped completely), maybe because my program didn't gave time between gear turns? Maybe. Probrably. We'll never know.

Since 3rd time it's the charm, the DRV8833 H bridge drive, my friend Dudu gave me, worked fine and finally Carronho came to life hitting everything in it's path, twisting like crazy and blinking a lot.
